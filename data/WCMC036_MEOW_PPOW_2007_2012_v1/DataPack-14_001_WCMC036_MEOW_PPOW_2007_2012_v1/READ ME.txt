Earlier version-specific comments:
============================================
This dataset (WCMC-036) combines two separately published datasets: the “Marine Ecoregions Of the World” (MEOW; 2007) and the “Pelagic Provinces Of the World” (PPOW; 2012). These datasets were developed by Mark Spalding and colleagues in The Nature Conservancy. Alongside the individual authors, partners for the MEOW layer included WWF, Ramsar, WCS, and UNEP-WCMC. The ecoregions and pelagic provinces are broadly aligned with each other and are non-overlapping. The combined dataset should be used for all purposes, particularly spatial analyses.
